##### Web Scraper

Get started on web scraping by downloading the jsoup library from https://jsoup.org/download

In intellij, you can simply copy the jsoup jar files into a folder in the project, right click on the 
folder and click "Add as library". You can choose whether the library is at project, module or global level.

Have a look at SimpleWebScraper.java for some of the basics in using jsoup. Reference link is
